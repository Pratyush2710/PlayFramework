# PlayFramework
Hands on with the Play Framework creating a bookstore application

1. Download the play-java-starter-example-2.7.x from website
2. Rename folder to bookstoreapp
3. Edit build.sbt file project name to bookstoreapp
4. Use POSTMAN an API development environment to send GET and POST requests to the store
5. Alternatively, run the sbt server by 
        sbt run
        
        // To open in debug mode
        sbt run -jvm-debug 9999   (port number should be same as defined in Remote configurations)
